      <h2>About</h2>
      <p>François Durel’s work engages with notions of time, memory, and transformation, using the somatic qualities of materials such as leather to evoke complex emotional and psychological states. His sculptures reflect a meditative and painstaking process, reminiscent of surgical techniques. Durel’s work combines the visceral nature of the materials with their architectural forms — such as confessionals, separating walls, and deconstructed furnitures— exploring their psychoanalytical connotations in order to create spaces that evoke both ritualistic and deeply personal histories. Durel’s practice is rooted in an exploration of sacred and secular imagery, where the intersection of religion, eroticism, and social structures reveals layers of human experience and psychological tension. His work is often interpreted as a personal and collective exploration of suffering, discipline and reparation, suggesting both a critique of and a reverence to the complexities of secrecy, desire, and legacy. </p>
